# Stream 1 Project

###This is an initial trial

I intend to build a website for myself as an Independent Music Professional.
My activities cover various streams which can be broadly grouped in three groups.
1. Composition and Sound design,
2. Conducting and Performing
3. Teaching

I will split composition and sound design.
I will include Conducting but not Performing as I am not doing any of it as a source of income.
I will give a lot of attention to Teaching and Music tuition.
Another two sections will be About, which includes some bio information, and contact.

The main page is going to have a parallax effect with very few text, large and prominent. From each section, there will be links to other pages where there will be more detail.
I will probably make use of bootstrap within sections of the front page and in the linked pages.
